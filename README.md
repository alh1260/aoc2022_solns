My Advent of Code 2022 solutions

This is where I'm going to put my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/). The thing is,
mainly for the challenge of it, I decided to do the problems in BBC BASIC rather than a normal language! As such, 
I'm going to lay out this repo in much the same way as [cpg_bbcbasic](https://github.com/alh1260/cpg_bbcbasic), in
which I will provide the "tokenized" form of the source as well as a plaintext version.
